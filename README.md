# Random user generator

Building your first React project as a small web application with API's calls is the best way to learn and practice code.
What was my goal when I came up with this project?
Primary, by creating this application I wanted to learn more about the functional elements of React and learn more React tools.
What did I use in this project?
Many of the core concepts of React: hooks, props, components, JSX elements, state management and Bootstrap in React.
In this project, I didn't want to spend a lot of time with design, so that's why I used React-Bootstrap.

## About something the Web-application

This application uses an absolutely free API of [randomuser api](https://wwww.randomuser.me).
This API gives us lots of random data about the generated users, so it allows us to practice and experiment with the data from the API.
On this page, you can generate as many users as you want. Users can be generated with filters:
by nationalities, gender, user numbers.
You can delete the whole database that we generated.
You can edit and delete individual users from the list.

## The webapplication is published in [here](https://gerry9009.github.io/randomuser-generator/)
